# Progress of implemented Skills

I want to give a overview about which skills are already implemented and which
ones need some rework.

Some general notes:

* Area Damage Skills with explicit damage packets work, but are still vulnerable
  to advanced cheaters

* All kind of skills which are somehow special are not working, except listed otherwise
