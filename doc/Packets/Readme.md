# Packet documentation #

In this folder you find the documentation of the packet messages which are getting exchanged between client and server. 

As stated in the project readme, the protocol is the ENG (english version) of Season 6 Episode 3.

There is one file for each packet. If you want to create packet documentations, you can use the [Template](Template.md) as a starting point.
